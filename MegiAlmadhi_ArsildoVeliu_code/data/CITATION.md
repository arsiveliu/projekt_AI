## Usage in This Project

This campus navigation AI agent uses a grid-based abstraction derived from
the Global Navigation Dataset (GND) principles. The discretization allows:

1. Efficient reinforcement learning (Q-Learning)
2. Classical search algorithms (A*)
3. Real-time path planning
4. Scalable to different campus layouts

## Acknowledgments

We acknowledge the Computer Vision Lab at George Mason University and
Dr. Jing Xiao for making the Global Navigation Dataset available for
research purposes.
